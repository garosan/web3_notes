## Review - Fuzzing and invariant tests

Often, hacks result from scenarios you didn't anticipate or consider for testing. But what if you could write a test that checks for every possible scenario, not just one? This is known as **fuzz testing**.

An invariant is a property of the system that should always hold.

The Fundamental Principle: Testing Invariants

Each system, from a function to an entire program, has an integral property, often referred to as the _invariant_. This property must always hold true.

### Introducing Fuzz Tests and Invariant Tests

There are two popular methodologies when dealing with edge cases: using _fuzz tests/invariant tests_, or _symbolic execution_ (which we'll save for another day).

Foundry will automatically randomize data and use numerous examples to run through the test script. This test will be supplied random data from 0 to uint256.max(), as many times as you've conifigured runs.

> Reminder: You can configure the number of runs in your foundry.toml under the \[fuzz] variable

Stateless Fuzzing versus Stateful Fuzzing

`Stateful fuzzing`, instead of resetting the contract state for each new run, will use the ending state of your previous run as the starting state of your next.
