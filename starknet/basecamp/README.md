- Why Cairo?
- Why Starknet?
- Smart Wallets

- Starkware is the company that developed all the products and protocols. For example, StarkEx (a permissioned L2 validium with limited functions, used by dYdX and others). StarkNet is the permisionless L2 rollup. StarkNet Foundation is the non-profit handling all the grants, marketing, etc. its mission is to grow the StarkNet ecosystem.

- As of now (oct. 2024) you can pay gas fees with ETH and Stark token.

- Why Cairo? Cairo helps provide proof that the result of a computation or execution of a program is tamper-proof, the code has not been tampered with, even if you don't have access to compute the program yourself. _A regular computer is able to keep a supercomputer honest_.

- Cairo is a general-purpose knowledge. Eli Ben-Sasson published the paper in 2018, then found blockchain to be a good place to put the tech to use. Cairo has use cases outside of blockchain.

Cairo's features:

- Enables verifiable computation
- Runs on top of the CairoVM
- Syntax inspired by Rust
- Similar ownership model
- Strongly typed, traits, macros
- Can be used outside of Starknet
- No need to know ZK
