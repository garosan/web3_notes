- [2025 Will Be the Year That AI Agents Transform Crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/24/2025-will-be-the-year-that-ai-agents-transform-)

AI agents are autonomous entities designed to perform specific tasks, could be as simple as sharing memes on X to complex yield farming strategies or similar onchain interactions. Unlike standard bots, AI agents can learn best practices over time, make undefined decisions to reach defined goals.

- Virtuals Protocol
- ELIZA (open-source framework)
- bizarre rise of the Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) memecoin
- Terminal of Truth received a grant from Marc Andreesen, got 200k followers, became 1st AI KOL and pumped $GOAT to 1B mcap.
- Over 11k agents have launched on Virtuals.
- [aixbt agent](https://app.virtuals.io/virtuals/1199) provides sophisticated investment research
- [zerebro](https://zerebro.org/) creates unique digital art.
- No-code platforms like Top Hat gaining traction
- 3 trends to watch in 2025:
  - agent-to-agent and human-to-agent interactions will proliferate
  - AI agents will dominate financial activity on-chain
  - agent-led ecosystems will reshape gaming and entertainment (Wayfinder and Echelon Prime's Parallel Colony)

### ELIZA, ai16z, Eliza Labs, etc.

Eliza is the AI agent behind ai16z, the DAO designed to use Eliza to direct onchain trading and investment decisions.
The native token AI16Z, has an mcap of $850M as of Dec 16, 2024.

Other popular AI memecoins include Zerebro (ZEREBRO) and aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT), with market capitalizations of approximately $375 million and $250 million.

The ai16z DAO token has hit $1B mcap. A whale accumulating $AI16Z and $ZEREBRO is also accumulating $GRIFFIAN.

## [What Is Virtuals Protocol? How to Buy, Trade and Create AI Agents](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-virtuals-protocol-how-to-buy-trade-and-create-ai-agents)

- Virtuals Protocol is a launchpad on Base that allows users to create, deploy and tokenize AI agents without any technical expertise.
- Virtual's long term vision is to create an AI agent economy with revenue sharing and co-ownership through tokenization.
- As revenue sharing has mostly not gone online yet, AI agent tokens on the platform have largely been considered by most as ‚ÄúAI memecoins‚Äù for now.

What are AI agents? Some AI agents you may be familiar with include: Apple‚Äôs Siri, Google Voice and ChatGPT. You may think of AI agents as advanced bots. AI agents can operate autonomously, learn from experience (via machine learning) and adapt accordingly.

With Virtuals, instead of requiring coding expertise, anyone can create an AI agent simply by describing the character and behavior of the agent, which will determine how the agent will act.

Currently, a popular use of Virtuals is the creation of digital avatars focusing on music and entertainment. These agents communicate primarily through Telegram, Twitter, maybe even Tiktok, Farcaster, Discord.

AI agents could also manage their own on-chain wallet.

Virtuals Protocol‚Äôs First AI Agent, Virtual K-Pop Star, Luna.

Luna is the first AI agent launched by the Virtuals team themselves. Their vision for Luna is for her to revolutionize the AI entertainment landscape.

Luna is "livestreaming" [here](https://app.virtuals.io/virtuals/68).

Virtuals‚Äô Luna can be purchased through the platform and notably all trades have to be routed through the protocol‚Äôs native token VIRTUAL.

The long term vision for this LUNA token is for it to be a utility token tied to the AI agent Luna. there is currently no implementation or monetization of said token.

The VIRTUAL token is the official governance token of the platform

La principal novedad de agentes IA: ya no se limita a responder preguntas o realizar tareas simples, sino que ahora puede ejecutar procesos complejos y colaborar en flujos de trabajo avanzados.

Ya hay muchos proyectos que est√°n combinando IA + Blockchain, como Bittensor o ICP.
