# Section 01. Favorites

## Intro

In the repo link, you can find a repo for each of the lessons.
I.e. for this **Favorites** exercise, you can find the associated repo [here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu)

Introduction to Remix and then we will create our first `favorites.vy` file.

## Basics

To declare the pragma version:
(we will be using 0.4.0 which has a lot of additions and cool features)

```vyper
# pragma version 0.4.0
# This is a comment
```

To add a license:

```vyper
# @license MIT
```

## Compiling

Make the exercise of compiling this:

```vyper
# pragma version 0.4.0
```

Interestingly, we already get a ton of information in the compilation details:

A minimal ABI:

```
{
  "evmVersion": "",
  "version": "0.4.0"
}
```

A bytecode:

`61000361000f6000396100036000f35f5ffd84038000a1657679706572830004000011`

And a runtime bytecode:

`5f5ffd`

Notice that the comments are ignored by the compiler, are whatever you want in the comments, add a line, a haiku, a whole novel in the comments, the output bytecode will be exactly the same.
