# Develop an NFTs Collection

## Introduction

2 implementations:

- 1st, basic, collection of puppies stored in IPFS.
- 2nd, art will be stored on-chain, dynamic, changing on a criteria we set.

## What is an NFT

At their core, NFTs are tokens which exist on a smart contract platform, they can be viewed, bought and sold on marketplaces such as **[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)** and **[Rarible](https://rarible.com/)**.

### ERC 721 Standard

NFTs, and the ERC721 Token Standard, differ from ERC20s in a few fundamental ways.

ERC20s handle ownership via a simple mapping of a uint256 token balance to an address.

ERC721s, by contrast, each have a unique tokenId, these tokenIds are mapped to a user's address. In addition to a tokenId, ERC721s include a tokenUri.

For art use cases of NFTs, people used to include all the metadata (like the image of the NFT) on the blockchain which was extremely expensive. So a tokenUri was added to the standard so that you could just put the URL string of the associated image and some other metadata on the blockchain, this obviously becomes a very centralized point of failure.

Often a protocol will use a service like **[IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)** to store their images and metadata in a more decentralized way.

## Project Setup

```bash
mkdir nft-project
cd nft-project
forge init
```

- Remove `src/Counter.sol`, `test/Counter.t.sol` and `script/Counter.s.sol`.
- Make sure that your `.gitignore` contains `.env` and `broadcast/`.
- Create `src/BasicNft.sol`.

Install OpenZeppelin contracts:

`forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit`

Add the remapping in `foundry.toml`:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
remappings = ["@openzeppelin/contracts=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts"]
```

Import and inherit the ERC721.

### TokenURI

Hard to believe, but when NFTs began, `tokenUri` was an optional parameter, despite being integral to how NFTs are used and consumed today. TokenURI basically is an endpoint that returns the metadata for a given NFT.

Example schema:

```json
{
  "title": "Asset Metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
    },
    "image": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
    }
  }
}
```

As an exercise, we can check the PudgyPenguins contract on Etherscan [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8#readContract).

Go to the `tokenURI` function and enter any valid `tokenId`. This will return a string like:

`ipfs://bafybeibc5sgo2plmjkq2tzmhrn54bk3crhnc23zd2msg4ea7a4pxrkgfna/1000`

To see this in Chrome replace `ipfs://` with `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/`:

`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeibc5sgo2plmjkq2tzmhrn54bk3crhnc23zd2msg4ea7a4pxrkgfna/1000`.

Enter the above URL in Chrome and you'll see the metadata for this NFT. Once again, convert the image URL that you see:

`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNf1UsmdGaMbpatQ6toXSkzDpizaGmC9zfunCyoz1enD5/penguin/1000.png`

And voil√°, you'll see the image for that particular NFT, it should be the same as the one listed on OpenSea.

Both the `tokenUri` and `imageUri` for this PudgyPenguin are stored in IPFS. We will also use IPFS to store our DOGI NFTs.

### Our Code

So anytime someone mints a Doggie NFT, we need to assign a TokenURI to the minted TokenID.

The OZ implementation of ERC721 that we imported has its own virtual tokenURI function which we will override.

Let's add our own `tokenURI` function, our `BasicNft.sol` is looking like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

pragma solidity 0.8.26;

contract BasicNft is ERC721 {
    uint256 private s_tokenCounter;

    constructor() ERC721("Doggie", "DOGI") {
        s_tokenCounter = 0;
    }

    function tokenURI(
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public view override returns (string memory) {}
}
```

Now let's create a folder called `img` in our root. I will add 4 DOGI images I created with ChatGPT.

## Intro to IPFS

IPFS is a decentralized storage protocol, it doesn't do any computation. It basically works like this:

We provide our data to the IPFS network via a node, a hash is produced that points to the location and details of the data and also serves to verify the data's integrity.

You can check more info in these links:

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)
- [IPFS Docs](https://docs.ipfs.tech/)
- [IPFS Project explanation](https://iq.wiki/wiki/ipfs)

Let's download the Desktop IPFS application to start using it.

After downloading the Desktop app I uploaded my DOGI images, and I immediatly get a CID for all of them. I can now view them in my browser:

`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTx1tZNCySh1Q5Z6UNwhrjYZZJETbQLcvHFkvSjENiZzS`

## TokenURI function

Ok, now check this tokenURI provided by Cyfrin:

```json
{
  "name": "PUG",
  "description": "An adorable PUG pup!",
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSsYRx3LpDAb1GZQm7zZ1AuHZjfbPkD6J7s9r41xu1mf8?filename=pug.png",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "cuteness",
      "value": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

We could use this as the return value for our `tokenUri` function but that would mean every DOGI minted would be identical to each other. So instead, we will allow the user to pass a tokenUri (a json object) to the mint function and map this URI to their minted tokenId:

```solidity
contract BasicNft is ERC721 {
    uint256 private s_tokenCounter;
    mapping(uint256 => string) private s_tokenIdToUri;

    constructor() ERC721("Doggie", "DOGI") {
        s_tokenCounter = 0;
    }

    function mintNFT(string memory tokenUri) public returns (uint256) {
        s_tokenIdToUri[s_tokenCounter] = tokenUri;
    }

    function tokenURI(
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public view override returns (string memory) {
        return s_tokenIdToUri[tokenId];
    }
}
```

Awesome. Now let's actually mint the NFT and increment our token counter. We can mint the token by calling `_safeMint` from OZ.

Our final code should look like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

pragma solidity 0.8.26;

contract BasicNft is ERC721 {
    uint256 private s_tokenCounter;
    mapping(uint256 => string) private s_tokenIdToUri;

    constructor() ERC721("Doggie", "DOGI") {
        s_tokenCounter = 0;
    }

    function mintNFT(string memory tokenUri) public returns (uint256) {
        s_tokenIdToUri[s_tokenCounter] = tokenUri;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, s_tokenCounter);
        s_tokenCounter++;
    }

    function tokenURI(
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public view override returns (string memory) {
        return s_tokenIdToUri[tokenId];
    }
}
```

## Deploying and interacting with the contract

- [Txn hash](https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x6f748bce31b9851e7d3ede6befb20fc500eae0e277c8299b76f4e52cdefea174) of the deployed BasicNft contract.
- [Contract created](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xc282a7dd595f35ea7e29a114d98f3d05f515724f)

To test this, I created a `dogi001.json` file and uploaded it to IPFS. File content:

```json
{
  "name": "DOGI001",
  "description": "A cute dogi",
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTx1tZNCySh1Q5Z6UNwhrjYZZJETbQLcvHFkvSjENiZzS",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "cuteness",
      "value": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

Then I pass this string with the CID I got:

`ipfs://QmdUFESRZN2cN1pghHFW9bNwLYT6816bBaodVjwiaTTW5V`

Now to confirm everything went well, pass '0' (since its the 1st minted NFT) to the `tokenURI` function and we get back the exact same string. Pretty underwhelming so far!
