# Chapter 4. How to Build a DeFi Application or Protocol

## Basic Principles of Financial Tools

Let’s review the basic principles of financial tools. First, you have to put your money to work.

You have to make your money go do something to come back with more; Generally, you’ll be loaning out your money, and this amount of money that comes from your wallet to theirs is the principal.

Next, you have to loan that money to another person or entity—someone who isn’t related to you or your company.

Now, how does this money generate more money? You get a _rental fee_. That rental fee is revenue to you, and we call it interest.

There are 2 ways someone will lend you money. 1, if you have a credit score. This doesn't exist on the blockchain so we used collateral, that is locking some kind of money (more than the actual lended money) as a guarantee that you will pay back.

Finally, you need to consider the length of time the money is loaned out.

## Developing Your Application

This section is for readers who will be building decentralized financial protocols on blockchain.

Most of the products currently developed for the DeFi market are either illegal or impossible to maintain under basic business principles. Start from first principles and build cleanly.

**Don’t worry about what anyone else is building, or how much money they’ve raised, or from whom. If you are solving a major problem for your market, applying business principles and legal constraints, you’ll be miles ahead of any of your competitors.**

### Rule 1: Which Market?

Ask yourself the following question: who are you building for?

- Institutional market
- Enterprise market: this entire group tends to be the least risk averse out there but is generally not considered a source of early adoption. Realizing liquidity is their biggest concern. Investments that don’t lock up assets for years are incredibly appealing.
- Retail market: They don’t have access to the most important source of wealth building—investing in private companies—so they have to make do with the pieces they get access to. The lack of information, experience, and expertise available to this group makes them highly susceptible to fraud and scams

This is the group the regulations were designed to protect, and the more we design for this group yet refuse to acknowledge the reason the regulations exist (they don’t know what questions to ask, they are susceptible to emotional investing, they don’t have access to skilled and reliable sources, etc.), the more we seem like the wolves in sheep’s clothing the regulators accuse us of being. To fight this, please take note of the following:

- Retail investors are highly susceptible to abuse and trickery. You have an active responsibility to keep either scams or retail investors out of your space, even if you want to be decentralized.
- Consider how you will create stop-loss opportunities or other breakfalls to prevent this type of catastrophic loss.

### Rule 2: Did You Apply Basic Business Principles and Process?

Let’s look at those processes, to make sure you’re running something that can last.

Find a problem, a real problem. If there isn’t a real pain you can alleviate, or a real benefit (10 times better than whatever people are currently doing to resolve it), don’t build it.

Successful projects are aspirin, not vitamins. People pay for alleviation of current pain, not prevention of future pain. If they cared about prevention, we’d all be fit, happy, and rich. Look around. We are not.

Build your community

Who is going to be in your community? Primarily two types of people: those with the problem you’re investigating, and other developers who either have the problem or want to help resolve it.

### Rule 3: Where Do You Build?

You can build on a variety of platforms or even create your own.

Ethereum is still the largest, most prolific, most used, and most mature ecosystem in the blockchain universe

...HMM Still there's too much information here and it doesnt seem relevant to me at this moment.
