# Section 1. Foundry Simple Storage

## Dev Environment - Windows

For Windows, it all starts with running `wsl --install` on Powershell.

## Why Foundry?

Foundry Pros:

- It **leverages Rust** for compilation, offering significantly faster build times compared to frameworks like Hardhat or Brownie.
- It's entirely **Solidity-based**, eliminating the need to learn other programming languages

## Foundry Setup

Once WSL and VS Code are installed and everything is working let's install Foundry with:

`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`

Now let's run `foundryup`.

This will install four components: forge, cast, anvil, and chisel. To confirm the successful installation, run `forge --version`, `cast --version`, `anvil --version`, `chisel --version`.

## New Foundry Project

Run `mkdir foundry-simple-storage` and `cd foundry-simple-storage`.

To start a new project, run `forge init` inside the empty directory.

Keep in mind that by default `forge init` expects an empty folder. If your folder is not empty you must run `forge init --force .`

## Understanding Foundry tree structure

- `lib` is the folder where all your dependencies are installed. The default template comes with one dependency installed: Forge Standard Library. This is the preferred testing library used for Foundry projects.
- `script` is a folder that houses all your scripts
- `src` is the folder where you put all your smart contracts
- `test` is the folder that houses all your tests
- `foundry.toml` - gives configuration parameters for Foundry

- Run `forge build` to build the project
- Run `forge test` to run the tests

You'll notice that two new directories have popped up: `out` and `cache`.

The `out` directory contains your contract artifact, such as the ABI, while the `cache` is used by forge to only recompile what is necessary.

## Continue with the exercise

Delete all the `Counter` Solidity files inside `script`, `src` and `test`. Create `src/SimpleStorage.sol` and add the contents from [this](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-simple-storage-cu/blob/main/src/SimpleStorage.sol) file.

## `compile` and `build`

Difference between `forge compile` and `forge build` commands.

### Key Differences:

| Feature                      | `forge compile`              | `forge build`                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Focus**                    | Basic compilation            | Comprehensive build process          |
| **Includes Pre-Build Steps** | No                           | Yes (if specified in `foundry.toml`) |
| **Performance**              | Faster, minimal              | Potentially slower, complete         |
| **Use Case**                 | Development and quick checks | Deployment and final builds          |

### Recommendation:

- Use `forge compile` for quick iterative development.
- Use `forge build` when preparing for deployment, running a full suite of tests, or ensuring all configurations and optimizations are included.

## Introduction to Anvil

Anvil is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC.

To run Anvil you simply have to type `anvil` in the terminal.

This testnet node always listens on `127.0.0.1:8545` this will be our `RPC_URL` parameter when we deploy smart contracts here. More on this later!

- Read more on [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/)

## Deploy a smart contract locally

You can read [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create) all the options to deploy using `forge create`.

Try running `forge create SimpleStorage`. It should fail because we haven't specified a couple of required parameters:

1. `Where do we deploy?`
2. `Who's paying the gas fees/signing the transaction?`

## Deploy locally using Anvil

- Run `anvil` in one terminal

If you are working with Anvil you can skip the rpc url:

> **THIS IS JUST FOR DEMO AND EDUCATION PURPOSES**

**NEVER PASTE THE PRIVATE KEY, i.e. NEVER DO THIS:**

`forge create SimpleStorage --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`

> **The above is anvil's 1st test private key, it's a dummy private key**

## Using `--interactive`

`forge create SimpleStorage --interactive`

This will prompt us for our private key. I'll take the 1st of the ones given by Anvil, paste it (nothing actually shows but you click enter) and you get the following back:

```
Deployer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
Deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
Transaction hash: 0xe933149cbe9c0958a21367bbf2f30a26dcdb497bcb22da9642c2059a71907cf8
```

## Deleting your history

You can delete your bash history by typing `history -c`.

## Deploy using a script

In Foundry we keep our scripts in the `script` folder.

Please create a new file called `DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol`. Using `.s.sol` as a suffix is a naming convention for Foundry scripts.

Read the [best practices](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/best-practices#scripts) for Foundry scripts.

`DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";

contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
    function run() external returns (SimpleStorage) {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();

        vm.stopBroadcast();
        return simpleStorage;
    }
}
```

Make sure Anvil isn't running and run `forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol`.

You should get this output:

```bash
[â †] Compiling...
[â ”] Compiling 2 files with 0.8.19
[â ’] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 1.08s
Compiler run successful!

== Return ==
0: contract SimpleStorage 0x90193C961A926261B756D1E5bb255e67ff9498A1

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

If we didn't pass an RPC URL, where did this deploy to? If no RPC URL is specified, Foundry automatically launches an Anvil instance, runs your script and terminates the Anvil instance.

Now run an Anvil instance and in a new terminal type:

`forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545`

You will get the following output:

```bash
No files changed, compilation skipped

Contracts deployed with a Solidity version equal or higher than 0.8.20 might not work properly.

== Return ==

Estimated amount required: 0.000928194 ETH

==========================

SIMULATION COMPLETE. To broadcast these transactions, add --broadcast and wallet configuration(s) to the previous command. See forge script --help for more.
```

Emphasis on the _SIMULATION COMPLETE._. Is it deployed now?

No, the output indicates this was a simulation. But, we got a new folder out of this, the broadcast folder.

Now **to actually deploy it locally** run:

`forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`

In the Anvil terminal, you'll see:

```bash
Transaction: 0xedae1838f9887073ad402ab58227fbff9fc3ac3496da14470f4a305535cd3ac4
Contract created: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3

Block Time: "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 07:40:11 +0000"
```

## What is a transaction

What you need to remember here is that a `broadcast` folder was created. Look inside in the `run-latest.json` file and you'll see this:

```json
  "transactions": [
    {
      "hash": "0xedae1838f9887073ad402ab58227fbff9fc3ac3496da14470f4a305535cd3ac4",
      "transactionType": "CREATE",
      "contractName": "SimpleStorage",
      "contractAddress": "0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3",
      "function": null,
      "arguments": null,
      "transaction": {
        "from": "0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266",
        "gas": "0x6c852",
        "value": "0x0",
        "input": "0x60806...0033",
        "nonce": "0x0",
        "chainId": "0x7a69"
      },
      "additionalContracts": [],
      "isFixedGasLimit": false
    }
  ],
```

**QUICK TIP**: To read this `"gas": "0x6c852"` in a human-readable way you can do this in the terminal:

`cast --to-base 0x6c852 dec`

## To use an `.env` file

Create your `.env` file. **Remember to check that it's in your .gitignore!!**

Next run `source .env`. This adds the above-mentioned environment variables into our shell.

Now you can run your commands in the terminal like:

`some command --cmd $MY_ENV_VAR1 $MY_ENV_VAR2`

## ðŸš¨ PRIVATE KEY SAFETY ðŸš¨

But now you would have your private keys in plain text in your `.env` file.

Foundry has a very nice option called `keystore`. Using `forge script --keystore <PATH>` allows you to specify a path to an encrypted store file, encrypted by a password. Thus your private key would never be available in plain text.

Let's agree to the following:

1. For testing purposes use a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in an `.env` file as long as you don't expose that `.env` file anywhere.
2. Where real money is involved use the `--interactive` option or a [keystore file protected by a password](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23?tab=readme-ov-file#can-you-encrypt-a-private-key---a-keystore-in-foundry-yet).

## ðŸš¨ PRIVATE KEY SAFETY UPDATE ðŸš¨

You should never use a `.env` again, but instead **encrypt your Keys Using ERC2335**

For this example we will use `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` (key 0 from Anvil).

Type this in your terminal (not inside VS Code):

`cast wallet import nameOfAccountGoesHere --interactive`

You will be asked for your private key and a password to secure it. You will do this only once.

## Interacting with a smart contract using the CLI

Now we have `anvil` running and the smart contract is deployed. Copy the contact address.

We will use `cast send` to interact with our deployed contract:

`cast send 0xcontractAddress "store(uint256)" 1337 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`

Where `"store(uint256)"` is the signature of the function we're calling and `1337` is the argument passed to `store()`.

If you'd like to call the retrieve() function to read the number you'd do:

`cast call 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 "retrieve()"`

You will receive back the value in hex format. To convert do:

`cast --to-base 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000539 dec`

## Deploying our contract to a testnet or mainnet

For this exercise, this will be fairly easy, we will go the `.env` file route and replace the values with our actual private key with testnet funds and our RPC URL from Infura or Alchemy.

`forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`

## Verify your smart contract on Etherscan

Follow the instructions from here to verify your contract on Etherscan:

[Link](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/foundry-simple-storage/verify-smart-contract-etherscan)

## Cleaning up the project

Forge has a built-in command to format our code that we should always run:

`forge fmt`

Finally, include a `README.md` file. This file serves as a guide for anyone who wants to learn about your project, how to use it, or how to contribute to it.
