## S Token

Good for paying for fees, staking, running validators, governance.

You can stake S on https://my.soniclabs.com/. 14-day waiting period to withdraw.

Choose a reputable validator carefully.

At Sonicâ€™s launch, the total supply of S is 3.175 billion. Some additions will be implemented gradually:

### Airdrop

An additional 6% of the 3.175 billion S will be minted six months after Sonic launches. The airdrop features an innovative burn mechanism that gradually reduces the total supply of S tokens.

### Ongoing

Six months after Sonic launches, the network will mint additional S tokens to:

- Increase adoption
- Grow the team and scale operations to drive increased adoption
- Implement robust marketing initiatives and DeFi onboarding campaigns

To fund this program, an additional 1.5% of S (47,625,000 tokens) will be minted annually for six years, starting six months after the mainnet launch. To guard against inflation, the network will burn newly minted tokens not used during the year.

If Sonic Labs uses only 5,000,000 tokens in the first year, the network will burn the remaining 42,625,000 tokens.

### Block Rewards

we will not mint new tokens for block rewards during the initial four years. After that period, S block rewards will resume by minting new tokens at a rate of 1.75% per year to reward validators.
