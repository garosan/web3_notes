Let's call web3 the integrity web for a moment.

The integrity web is a new way to build social functions (like money). 3 novel properties:

- Openness
- Incentivized integrity
- Public verifiability

The modular ecosystem in 2023 and beyond is way more complex than it was in 2022 and before. A lot more layers, a lot more players.

## Blockchain Concerns

We can see that the functionality we need to provide falls into 3 categories

- Execution
- Settlement / Consensus
- Data availability

## Layer 2 Theory

Generalised L2s vs Application Specific L2s. In reality, most L2s are becoming generalized.

Most L2s are rollups.

Currently, the Sequencer is centralized for most L2s.
