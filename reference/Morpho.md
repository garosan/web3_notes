- [Morpho](https://docs.morpho.org/)

Morpho enables the deployment of minimal and isolated lending markets by specifying:

- one collateral asset,
- one loan asset,
- a Liquidation Loan To Value (LLTV),
- an Interest Rate Model (IRM),
- and an oracle.

designed to be more efficient and flexible than any other decentralized lending platform.

Morpho has a permissionless market creation mechanism, where anyone can create a market with a different collateral token, borrowable token and oracle (IRM & LLTV are allowed by governance).

Such as Uniswap, you can be vulnerable to loss of funds if you use a random market where the oracle or the tokens involved in the market can be dumb. So, we recommend you use only the markets that are listed in the Morpho Interface.
