# Chapter 5. Making Money with DeFi

## Investing with a DeFi Protocol on Blockchain

The current incarnation of DeFi does not really reflect the potential of DeFi, or what it will be in the future. 

Future DeFi will be more along the lines of secured peer-to-peer finance, or lending directly between individuals and/or companies without using banks, secured by some sort of asset as collateral.

Right now, it's a set of ungoverned, noncompliant DApps that offer great potential gain, with equal risk. Unless fiat or another asset class (like a real-world asset) is involved, there is no real risk mitigation.

## Is It Really “Investing”?

Not really. There are 2 primary types of investing:

- Equity investing: Buying stocks from companies, holding for long times, etc.
- Financial tool investing: Like lending money, bonds, etc.

In the current iteration of DeFi, however, the loans that are made often don’t end up in an enterprise that increases in value or generates real revenue. People gain returns by putting money into a variety of applications, each promising a yield, or interest rate. The yield is supposed to be in exchange for locking up (promising not to sell) particular tokens, making tokens available for a protocol’s use, conducting particular transactions with the token, etc.

Some yields promises make sense like staking or lending protocols. Others don't make much sense. These tend to be unsustainable and collapse.

If the founding team of the protocol is able to access the tokens, collateral, or any of the funds related to the DApp rather than an unhosted community wallet, this is not DeFi.

## DeFi Protocol Types

### Protocol 1: Staking a Token

This is one of the easiest, simplest types of DeFi DApps. You deposit a token which is normally used to make the network stronger. It gains a certain amount based on the APY

This type generally merits a token, because you are supporting the stability and liquidity of proof-of-stake chains, and adding to the staked validator nodes. When the validator node to which your tokens are attached is selected to validate, and is subsequently rewarded, your tokens are rewarded, as well. Your payment of additional tokens is then deposited to your account.

You can stake from centralized exchanges, like Coinbase, decentralized exchanges, like Uniswap, or directly from wallets, like Trust Wallet.

APR is based on the amount you owe. It means annual percentage rate, and it is the yearly interest rate on the money you borrow, including fees, but not including any compounding on the interest (also known as straight interest).

APY, or annual percentage yield, is based on the amount you earn. This is the yearly rate you earn on the money you loan, and it includes compounding.

This process has a few quirks. For example, when you want to sell a staked token, make sure you select “unstaking” if it isn’t automatically done for you.

You cannot sell or move the token if your token is in a custodial or locked protocol or wallet.

Sometimes you’ll see a protocol that looks like a staking protocol (“Deposit token here, get paid X%!”), but it’s not to secure a chain. Instead, it’s to lock up tokens.

Here, while you’re basically getting paid to lock up your token, it’s unclear how the money you are locking up is generating revenue to pay your return.

If the yield is being paid from money paid in from new investors, it’s most likely a Ponzi scheme (e.g., Anchor protocol).

If there is a revenue source, it may be from a highly risky scheme with unhedged risk (see Celsius) or another unsustainable scheme (Hex). 

### Protocol 2: Lending Protocols

Here you are loaning out your money for it to be returned with interest.

Subprotocol 2A: Liquidity Provider on a Swap or Decentralized Exchange

A swap exchange is a decentralized exchange that is an automated market maker (AMM), a type of exchange that runs on a matching algorithm instead of matching by brokers

### Whole chapter on memecoins


Memecoins are tokens without any function or purpose, usually based on a pop culture or crypto culture meme or joke. The first memecoin, DOGE, began as a joke based on a shiba inu meme that was floating around the internet. (It was the “doggy” coin.) However, it quickly became an important experiment in decentralization. Could a token be created and function entirely without input from any founding team member? It turns out it could—it grew a huge community supporting this shocking development. Every other token has had a founding that was required to maintain the token or contracts associated with it, but not DOGE. The founding members have long since moved on, and it has autopiloted its way to glory as our most decentralized coin.13

Memecoins are dominated by short-term traders known as degens in this space. Memecoins are highly trendy and volatile. But they can be fun; they provide an easy way for those who don’t know anything about crypto to discover it, and some incredible communities have resulted, so we appreciate those who make memecoins their home.

However, note that these communities often aren’t really communities; they are groups of degens focused almost exclusively on price. Conversation about “floors” (lowest market price) or market price will dominate. The problem is that degens tend to dump the coin as soon as a significant price increase is reached. You risk becoming exit liquidity for the degens. A few whales, or large accounts, or founders with large holdings but no restrictions on trading pose the same risk.

There is no real way to determine the innate value of any particular memecoin, because they are expressly designed to have no value. There are, however, some coins that have grown into unique value. ApeCoin is the token that will govern Otherside, the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s metaverse, and Shiba Inu will form the basis of a new chain called Shibarium, offering low-cost transactions. Others offer unique educational communities or support for scam victims. They tend to be quite cheap, which is the draw for most people.

These tokens are usually unlimited in supply (which usually means declining value unless a burn program is put into place), extremely volatile, and thinly traded. They are much more likely to be scams, and they may be deemed securities. Average returns are 0, and the risks are that they are either scams or disappear overnight. Most are scams or will simply go to $0/disappear overnight.

However, some survive, at least for a period of time. There isn’t an agreed-upon way to analyze these for opportunities, so a summary of methods I’ve seen or read from others generally includes the following.

Things to Consider
I mentioned the fundamentals used by investors. Unfortunately, we don’t have things like financial statements and key ratios for cryptocurrency, and certainly not for memecoins. If you are interested in learning more about how to value assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, as well as how to value stocks, I have a course that goes into far more detail.

Memecoins are a bit odd because of the sheer lack of utility and unique communities that form around them. So we have to substitute other ways to judge the value of any particular token.

The following are a variety of factors to consider, in no particular order. These are only suggestions. Use whichever criteria make sense to you and your investment criteria, and rank and weight them accordingly.

First, check the site of the memecoin for red flags like cut-and-paste language, misspellings, or a general unprofessional appearance. Memecoin sites that aren’t run as scams tend to look very good. Marketers are often part (or most) of memecoin teams, and they know how to pull together a decent site quickly.

Second, check the web and social media for information, especially Crypto Twitter (now X) and any Telegram groups. What news can you find out? Focus on news that isn’t sponsored or paid for. Note that many Twitter spaces may be paid advertisements that the hosts don’t disclose. Also check CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap for information about the coin.

Find out about the holders. How many holders are there? Do the founders hold an outsized amount? You can find this information on their website or CoinBrain. More concentration of holders means greater likelihood of manipulation. Check the security of the smart contracts and the likelihood of a scam, as well as the cost of selling (a sell tax) on CoinBrain while you’re at it.

See how much liquidity is in the market. You need a good amount of trading volume in a 24-hour period, which means people are buying and selling. Note that some of this may be bot trading, which can be good (preparing for an exchange listing) or bad (simple price manipulation or the appearance of interest). Also, new memecoins tend to struggle when they are below $10 million in market cap, and start hitting their stride above that. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko can help with this.

Finally, join the community. Is this a community you want to be part of? Do they seem excited, happy to be there? Do they talk about the coin “mooning” only, or are they really establishing their feet as a community?

These are suggestions only. There are many ways of picking memecoins, at least one of which I suspect consists of a list of coins and a dart, so do what works for you.

Whatever you do, make sure you put in only what you can afford to lose.
