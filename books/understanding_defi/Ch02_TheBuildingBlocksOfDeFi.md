# The Building Blocks of DeFi

These building blocks are protocols, platforms, decentralized applications (DApps), wallets, stablecoins, and governance tokens.

## Protocols

Protocols are just a set of rules and procedures. DeFi protocols are the rules and procedures for lending and borrowing without using banks. These protocols are used in one of two things: a platform or a DApp. Let’s discuss the difference between the two.

## Platforms

Blockchain platforms, as they currently stand, have a few basic requirements and one main issue to resolve.

A Trilemma Solution

First, you need a trilemma solution. The blockchain trilemma is based on a classic issue in international finance regarding the three competing requirements of national monetary policy, only two of which can be achieved at any given time.

Accordingly, anyone trying to innovate in blockchain will have to address three competing interests, only two of which can be met by a blockchain solution. The interests are decentralization, scalability, and security.

Deployment Network

the structural base of the platform. In blockchain, this is fundamentally the block-based recordkeeping system.

You can use any language that works. Smart contracts are the programs that drive the whole system.

Blockchain currently runs on smart contracts that are triggered by tokens specific to that platform

The platform will need some sort of operational software to allow nodes to run the platform.

### Virtual machine

Not all platforms use virtual machines. Ethereum’s virtual machine is probably the best known.

## Dapps

DApps are similar to traditional applications. However, instead of being run on a centralized server, they run on a blockchain platform.

The following are the four main elements of a true DApp.

Incentivized
Decentralized
Open Source (Maybe)

## Wallets

Your wallet has two keys, a public key and a private key. Your public key is what people use when they want to send you something.
You also have a private key, which is the authorization to send assets out of your account. So, public key is assets in, private key is assets out.

## Stablecoins

## Governance Tokens

Governance tokens are tokens that give the holder some sort of voting and/or proposal right over the blockchain project or its protocol.

Many projects use the one token/one vote rule (each holder gets one vote).

Other methods of offering governance capability exist, such as offering governance tokens to active members of the project or the project DAO, offering quadratic or other ranked voting models, or soul-bound governance tokens.

Now that I’ve discussed the building blocks of DeFi, let’s look at some of the primary ways people have put these tools to use.

### Lending

This is what is getting most of the press, because this is the way people are making money.

Collateralized loans are the core of what is powering DeFi right now.
