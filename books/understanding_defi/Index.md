## Preface

DeFi, is just about finance without banks.

This book is about understanding the entirety of the space‚Äîwhere it fits into blockchain, its core elements, how to operate in the space, and the future of DeFi.

This book is for anyone who wants to build compliantly and productively.

After reading this book, you should have the understanding and knowledge to help design, build, and operate successfully within the DeFi arena, however it progresses.

## Chapter 1. Introduction to DeFi

You need to understand the boundaries of the game before you take on the advanced plays, so we have to help you understand what blockchain is and how it works before we get into one type of blockchain application.

### What Is Blockchain?

What do you do when you need to work with people but can‚Äôt trust them? You need a trustless system. something that assumes that people are lying‚Äîand still operates effectively.

it‚Äôs a pretty complex topic and all the jargon can make you feel intimidated, but it‚Äôs important to remember that blockchain is just a technology.

At its heart, blockchain is a technological implementation of Yuri Ijiri‚Äôs _triple-entry bookkeeping_.

### A Brief History of Accounting

- Single-Entry Bookkeeping

IOUs are the oldest form of accounting, known as single-entry bookkeeping.

the IOUs were the first credit cards‚Äîphysical proof that the debt existed and could be collected.

Limitations of single entry bookkeeping: A simple receipt didn‚Äôt show that anything was received in exchange, nor did it protect against fraud or theft.

People started to realize that when expenses are investments, they should look different from expenses that are simply repeat spends of consumable goods.

- Double-Entry Bookkeeping

In the 11th century, bankers of the medieval Middle East created double-entry bookkeeping

This was revolutionary because it required both parties to enter both sides of a transaction, assuring greater accuracy and reliability, as well as account for expenses and revenue as they actually impacted the total company, rather than simple cash flow.

In other words:

This is the move from recording ‚ÄúI owe you one bale of grain‚Äù to ‚ÄúYou gave me three goats, so I owe you one bale of grain.‚Äù

Then...we kind of got stuck.

Accounting isn‚Äôt exactly a field that drives innovation. When something works, we tend to keep to the status quo until that status quo simply doesn‚Äôt work any longer.

### Massive Fraud, or the Status Quo Officially Doesn‚Äôt Work Any Longer

But then, in 1997, the Asian banking crisis happened.

Quickly on its heels came the accounting scandals of the 2000s. Enron, WorldCom, HealthSouth, Tyco, AIG‚Äîthe early 2000s are a ghostly graveyard of blue-chip companies that were cheating shareholders

With the double-entry system, everything is accounted for in arrear, and anything can change or be changed from the moment of entry up until the accounts are audited by an impartial third party. Unaudited accounts were subject to any sort of editing with any sort of rationale, by accident or intention.

### Triple-Entry Bookkeeping

In 1988, Dr. Yuji Ijiri, created momentum accounting or 3-entry bkeeping.

Momentum accounting is a method of accounting that helps forecasting;

But one person did read the monograph, eventually. On June 26, 2005, Ian Grigg, a financial cryptographer and later member of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute.

Triple-Entry Accounting This is the core thesis of what later became blockchain technology. As digital cash was maturing (through online banking, ATM machines, etc.), Grigg noticed the failure of double-entry bookkeeping to account for potential fraud. More importantly, however, he created a solution.

### The Bitcoin Revolution: The First Blockchain Use Case

In October 2008 Satoshi published his whitepaper...Nakamoto advocated creation of encrypted blocks to track these transactions through time, as they were happening.

While many count this as the genesis of blockchain, it is really the origin of a single practical application method of an auditable trail transfer system.

It is this application, the Bitcoin blockchain, that is the model for all currently developed blockchain technology, but it is important to remember that this is just one part of the true innovation‚Äîan auditable trail transfer system.

**Remember that the current structure of blockchain, including the Bitcoin blockchain and all the other tokenized blockchain, isn‚Äôt the only way to create this system of verified, immutable, auditable trail accounting. Nakamoto was offering only an example, not a definitive methodology, of auditable trail transfer technology.**

**It‚Äôs probably not even the best way to do this‚Äîmore efficient methods of immutable digital signature recordkeeping are out there and will likely emerge in the next two to three years. Blockchain platforms could also be done without being peer to peer, or listing all transactions since genesis, or without using tokens, or many other ways. The token-based system of the Bitcoin blockchain is just the one we came up with first, and now it‚Äôs our default method for the moment.**

A certain standard format or rule structure has to win so developers can focus more on things to do with the technology instead of how to create the technology.

### Ethereum and the Smart Contract Revelation

Bitcoin is nothing more than a coin representing a value.

Many people believe bitcoin could be a substitute for fiat (government-issued currency, such as the US dollar). But it is fundamentally impossible for bitcoin to be a currency.

First, bitcoin is deflationary.

Regardless of need or demand, if some are accidentally lost or burned, that‚Äôs it. No more. And that‚Äôs as much a problem as something that‚Äôs inflationary, or in limitless supply.

Currencies need to have a supply that can expand and contract as needed, so supply and demand meet as perfectly as possible. Why? Because the purpose is to keep a currency as stable in value as possible, not have it rise or drop.

Currencies have to be stable and predictable, which means they need to be adjustable and nonvolatile. Having 21 million, no more, no less, means it is not adjustable.

People hoard bitcoin for just this reason, and are concerned about facing loss or losing potential upside when exchanging bitcoin for goods or services. Why? Because it has potential upside and loss‚Äîit‚Äôs volatile, and you can‚Äôt fix that volatility without supply adjustability.

So‚Äîit‚Äôs an asset.

...me estoy brincando muchas cosas que ya hemos visto en otro lado

#### Ethereum‚Äôs Innovation: Self-Executing Programming ‚Üí Smart Contracts

Finally, in December 2013, a 21-year-old developer named Vitalik Buterin released a whitepaper on his blog proposing a new vision of audited trail technology, moving beyond the financial use case evinced by Bitcoin

### What Does Any of This Have to Do with Finance?

Finance, in general, can best be described as money making money. When you hear people say you need to ‚Äúput your money to work,‚Äù they are often speaking of putting your money into some sort of financial tool so you can generate more money with it.

How does that work? Through the magic of interest and time

When you put your money into a standard bank account, you get access to three powerful tools

the ability to store your funds in a safe location, the ability to convert someone‚Äôs debt to you into cash that is available for use, and the ability to convert your money in whatever form it exists to digital cash

It‚Äôs difficult to buy most goods and services in the US without some form of digital payment‚Äîeither a credit or debit card. This is the fundamental problem of the unbanked: it‚Äôs not that they have zero access to funds; it‚Äôs that they have no cheap or convenient way to store it, which is why predatory lenders like check-cashing companies and pawnshops are able to prey on them so easily.

### How Money Flows in Banks and Economies

Most economies flourish only with economic activity‚Äîthat is, when money changes hands.

Most governments view the role of government as primarily to monitor redistribution, not to enforce a more equal flow of money to and from parties.

Even China, with its economy that is actively managed by the government, as opposed to the US system of economic management through free markets, experienced trouble with the tendency of many Chinese families to save up to 30% of their income. They had to encourage spending to release those funds, which was a big trigger for the growth of the middle and upper classes we‚Äôve seen in the past few decades.

But between zero investable cash and $5,000 in investable cash lives around 95% of the population. That banks don‚Äôt care about. At all.

And that‚Äôs the problem with traditional finance: most people don‚Äôt want you to be able to do it. Especially banks.

### What Is Decentralized Finance, and Why Is It Important?

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is money making money, like centralized finance, but without using banks. Does it sound more interesting already? I think so too.

Instead of banks controlling access to financial tools, anyone can get access to the magical tools of interest and time to generate and maintain generational wealth.

No one will limit your access based on your income, your last name, your ethnicity, your address, your education, your alma mater, your parentage, or even your legal status within a country. If you want access, you get it.

So the openness of DeFi is a bit illusory. Anyone can participate, but the advantage clearly lies with those who have the background to understand what is happening in real time. And those people are the already wealthy investors, who have access to both traditional finance (TradFi) via banks, and nontraditional finance, through DeFi.
