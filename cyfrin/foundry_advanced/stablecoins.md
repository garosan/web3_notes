## DeFi and the future of Finance Excerpts

Intended to maintain price parity with some target asset, USD, or gold. Stablecoins provide the necessary consistency that investors seek to participate in many DeFi applications.

The three primary mechanisms by which stablecoins maintain its peg are:

- Fiat-collateralized
- Crypto-collateralized
- Non-collateralized

By far the largest class of stablecoins are fiat collateralized (backed by an off-chain reserve of the target asset). The largest of these is USDT or Tether, with a market cap of $140B (Dec. 2024). The 2nd biggest one is USDC by Coinbase with a market cap of $43B. These 2 are centralized and reserve the right to blacklist accounts or freeze tokens at will.

The second largest class of stablecoins are crypto-collateralized. The most popular crypto-collateralized stablecoin is DAI, created by MakerDAO.
